\chapter{Preface}
This dissertation is the result of my work within (mostly) theoretical computer science, more specifically, in the area of algorithms and data structures. It was prepared during my enrollment as a PhD student in the \fix{ITMAN graduate school} at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science in partial fulfillment of the requirements for acquiring a PhD degree at the Technical University of Denmark.

%\todo{Write preface}
%This PhD dissertation was prepared at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark in partial fulfillment of the requirements for acquiring a PhD degree in Computer Science. \fix{ITMAN}

The thesis contains a general introduction that contains a basic introduction to the field of algorithms and data structures and a description of the results I have obtained during my PhD, followed by seven included original papers. The papers are the full body of research I have produced during my enrollment, and five of them were peer-reviewed and published at international conferences, with the remaining two in submission.


\paragraph{Managed Video as a Service}
My PhD scholarship was funded by a grant from the Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation (H{\o}jteknologifonden) for the project \emph{Managed Video as a Service}. The project was conceived by Aalborg University, the Technical University of Denmark, Milestone Systems and Securitas in collaboration, scheduled to last for four years and to involve four PhD students (and advisors), as well as funding for improvements to a software system built by Milestone Systems.

My part of the project was called \emph{Algorithms for Metadata}. Its goal was to research and develop compressed data structures for indexing massive amounts of meta data that supports efficient queries, in the software system built by Milestone Systems to support massive deployments of surveillance cameras. One of my papers is a direct result of my involvement in this project, being an efficient index for finding movement in surveillance footage. This paper also contains the only prototype I have created, and my only experimental results. All other works are motivated by theoretical curiosity.
